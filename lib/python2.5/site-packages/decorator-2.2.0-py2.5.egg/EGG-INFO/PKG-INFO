Description: As of now, writing custom decorators correctly requires some experience
        and it is not as easy as it could be. For instance, typical implementations
        of decorators involve nested functions, and we all know
        that flat is better than nested. Moreover, typical implementations
        of decorators do not preserve the signature of decorated functions,
        thus confusing both documentation tools and developers.
        
        The aim of the decorator module it to simplify the usage of decorators
        for the average programmer, and to popularize decorators usage giving
        examples of useful decorators, such as memoize, tracing,
        redirecting_stdout, locked, etc.
